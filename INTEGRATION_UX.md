# Integration User Experience

This document describes the user experience for developers and merchants when integrating and using the new Product Catalog features. We will follow Stripe's established multi-layered approach to cater to different user needs.

## Level 1: No-Code Experience (Stripe Dashboard)

For merchants who prefer a visual interface, all core catalog features will be manageable directly within the Stripe Dashboard.

*   **Dashboard-Based Catalog Management**: A new, enhanced "Products" section in the Dashboard will allow merchants to:
    *   Create and manage products with all new attributes (variants, inventory, categories).
    *   View real-time inventory levels and status.
    *   Configure pricing options, including  and .
*   **Bulk CSV Import/Export**: To facilitate easy migration and management of large catalogs, we will provide a robust CSV import/export tool that supports all new product fields.
*   **One-Click Sync for Major Platforms**: For merchants on platforms like Shopify, BigCommerce, or WooCommerce, we will offer a simple, one-click process to connect their store and automatically sync their entire product catalog with Stripe. The initial setup will guide them through authentication and mapping fields.

## Level 2: Low-Code Integration (APIs & Pre-built Components)

For developers who want more control without building from scratch, we will provide a low-code path.

*   **Enhanced Product & Price APIs**: The core of the integration will be the updated  and  APIs, which will include all the new fields for variants, inventory, pricing, and categorization.
*   **Pre-built Sync Connectors**: For developers integrating with platforms that don't have a one-click app, we will offer pre-built connectors and detailed guides for syncing data from sources like Salsify, Akeneo, and others.
*   **Full-Featured Payment Links & Checkout**: Merchants will be able to leverage the full power of the new catalog features directly through Payment Links and Checkout Sessions. This includes showing inventory status, offering product variants, and enabling dynamic pricing on the checkout page with minimal API changes.

## Level 3: Custom Integration (Full API Control)

For large platforms and businesses with unique needs, we will offer complete control via our APIs.

*   **Full API Access**: All catalog features will be programmatically accessible via the API, allowing for deep, custom integrations.
*   **Webhook Events for Catalog Changes**: We will introduce a new set of webhook events to notify applications of changes in the product catalog.
    *   
    *   
    *   
    *   These events will enable real-time synchronization between Stripe and external systems.
*   **Advanced Features**: The API will expose advanced functionality like dynamic pricing rules, inventory reservations, and programmatic management of product categories and tags.

## Onboarding and Migration Strategy

*   **For Existing Users**: We will provide a seamless migration path. The system will auto-detect their current product usage and suggest relevant catalog enhancements. The adoption of new features will be gradual and optional, not a forced upgrade.
*   **For New Users**: The Stripe Dashboard will feature a guided setup flow to help new users create their first product and populate their catalog. We will provide sample product templates for different industries (e.g., SaaS, ecommerce, retail) to get them started quickly. The onboarding process will also include recommendations for the best integration path based on their platform and business model.
