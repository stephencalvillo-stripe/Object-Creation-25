# Complete Product Catalog Initiative: Overview

This document provides a high-level summary of Stripe's Complete Product Catalog initiative.

## ðŸŽ¯ What We're Building

The project has three main pillars:

1.  **Enhanced Catalog Infrastructure**: We will expand our existing Product and CheckoutSession APIs to include comprehensive ecommerce primitives such as product variants, inventory quantity/status, expanded price options (e.g., `comparedTo` pricing, `priceRange`), categorization data (product types, tags, categories), and expanded order states.

2.  **Cross-Platform Syncing**: We will build a new product to sync Stripe Catalog data with third-party product catalog providers (like Salsify, Syndigo, and Akeneo) and multi-channel feed managers (like Goflow, Sellercloud, and SellerActive).

3.  **AI Commerce Gateway**: We will build a new API for emerging AI-powered selling channels (like OpenAI and Perplexity) to pull in and sell products from Stripe merchants. This will give sellers an immediate reason to sync their catalog with Stripe and provide a unified interface for AI assistants to access Stripeâ€™s entire product ecosystem.

## ðŸš€ The Vision

Our goal is to make any merchant's catalog available across all sales channels, with a special focus on AI assistants. By becoming the connective tissue between merchants and new commerce surfaces, we help businesses capture demand the moment it appears.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters

*   **Bear Case (Conservative View)**: A richer product catalog enables richer features on Stripe, driving more revenue for our users. This includes capabilities like full-funnel adaptive pricing, effective cross-sells/upsells, and accurate shipping promises.
*   **Bull Case (Ambitious View)**: Stripe becomes the universal commerce layer. AI platforms get instant access to millions of products, merchants reach new customers through AI assistants, and Stripe acts as the unifying infrastructure for it all.

## ðŸ”„ How This Differs from Previous Attempts

Unlike prior efforts, this approach has a lower barrier to entry, provides more immediate value through our expanded OCS footprint, and capitalizes on the new, significant opportunity presented by AI-driven commerce.
